## Extra files 

I will (try to) collect my files here. The rule is, if I use it more than three times (and if I remember), I will save it here.
These will be isolated tiny functions that I think it won't go into the main repo.  

Please create issues for questions or bugs. Happy debugging. 

- `my_cbc_chk.f`:
  __Usage__: quick debugging, print all distinct BC types and count the number.

   You can call the subroutine `my_cbc_chk(s3)` anywhere in userdat2, userdat3, or userchk with different tags like
   ```
   call my_cbc_chk('aaa')
   call my_cbc_chk('bbb')
   ```
   It will print something like this with ifield, type, CBC, #faces
   ```
   aaa BC:   0 PR   E         768
   aaa BC:   1 VEL  E         608
   aaa BC:   1 VEL  P          96
   aaa BC:   1 VEL  W          64
   aaa BC:   2 S00  E         608
   aaa BC:   2 S00  P          96
   aaa BC:   2 S00  t          64
   aaa BC:   3 MHD  E         608
   aaa BC:   3 MHD  P          96
   aaa BC:   3 MHD  W          64
   ```
   This subroutine is intensively used as my personal debugging routine. Works for many cases up to 72000 ranks.
   Nek repo uses this https://github.com/Nek5000/Nek5000/pull/787 to print BCs which will give you UNKNOWN when the BC is not in the table.  This one is more versatile. 

- `flip_elements/`: flip from lhs to rhs. for wired wrap with mirror direction

- `change_time.py:

   This change the time in header from atime to timestep*1.0 in order to bypass Paraview's struggle of reading nonincreasing time / timestep.
   ```
   python3 ./change_time.py avgeddy.nek5000
   ```
