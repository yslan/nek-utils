### Meshing script template

Meshes generated by genbox, prenek and n2to3 can be scripted. Here is a template that does the job.

The path of the tools from the list `$tools` will be checked, which makes the script more portable.

### Usage:

- Run the script
  ```
  ./mkmsh.sh
  ```

- Run the script on server (wihout GUI) (require `xvfb-run`)
  ```
  GUI=0 ./mkmsh.sh
  ```

- Clean the tmp file and msh files
  ```
  ./mkmsh.sh clean
  ```

- Set the path of Nek5000 repo if it's not at $HOME/Nek5000.
  ```
  NEK5000_PATH=<path to Nek5000> ./mkmsh.sh
  ```



### TODO:

- maybe remove newly generated meshes in clean mode as well (over engineering?)
